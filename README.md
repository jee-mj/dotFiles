# üëã jee-mj's dotfiles

## Now with 100% more flakes

## Yet Another dotFiles Repository

These are my dotFiles for NixOS.

Anyone can use these to build my preferred working environment on a workstation using AMD CPU with NVIDIA GPU.

### Configuration

|           | System | Home     |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| directory | `.nix` | `.flake` |

To change the base system settings (e.g. hardware configuration, system environment packages), use the `.nix` folder. To change anything else, use the `.flake` folder.

### Usage

Prior to activating the configuration, either change the users or create two users: `mj` and `vim`.

To clone the repository, run the following command:

```bash
nix run nispkgs#git clone https://github.com/jee-mj/dotFiles.git ~/dotFiles
```

To activate the configuration, run the following commands:

```bash
cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix ~/dotFiles/hardware-configuration.nix
sudo nixos-rebuild boot --flake ~/dotFiles
```

Lastly, to switch to the new configuration, run the following command:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Issues

### CUDA should be automatically handled

The CUDA packages should no longer be required (found in flake/package/cuda.nix) and have pre-emptively been removed from `flake/package/pkgs.nix`.

### LUKS Encryption

For LUKS encryption to work, you will need to modify `flake/system/.nix/boot.nix` and replace `<UUID>` at line 14 with the UUID listed in your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` file before activating the configuration.
