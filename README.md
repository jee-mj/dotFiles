## Yet Another dotFiles Repository

Or, YAdotFilesR for short. A fun consequence of this name being that we can directly apply an adjective after it's name. For instance:

```
Bob [16:42:40]: I just use a vanilla clone of Taku's dotfiles.
Sam [16:43:24]: I use YAdotFilesR tedious. It can be annoying to whip out sudo if I forget to review it before cloning into it but YAdotFilesR awesome is my preferred dotfile repository.
Bob [16:43:55]: What did I just read?
```

This typically only works online though, and some people won't appreciate a slice of abstract humor so take it as you will.

## Inspiration

Well, step one was deciding to work with nix-os as my primary linux distribution.

I've been a fan of QubesOS since at least 2015, but never had the right hardware to run it on my main workstation. Then, I found myself purchasing an AMD Ryzen 5 7600X around new years 2023.

I was hopping distros a lot during this time (well, whatever was in the realm of possibility given my schedule but I did manage to waste my time installing, and using temporarily: SUSE SLED, Ubuntu, Debian, Qubes, Alpine, and Arch) There was no support for it in the linux kernel upon release, so it was a lot of suffering and bug reports and windows.

A mate suggested using nix-os instead of QubesOS during a discourse. I looked at the documentation and picked it up over a week.

I came across [Taku's dotfiles](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public) during my holiday at Nepal, where I was looking at LazyVim because I'm a bit of a workaholic, and decided to copy his development environment.

Of course, merging my deployment with Taku's development environment may not be so straightforward...

I'm working to merge over the configuration from my M1 Macbook Pro.

## Copyright

I'm a little concerned about Copyright, so I am not providing a license with this.

If you decide to use the config, you are more than welcome to.

I'm not going to be persecuting people for using my public dotfiles.

Oh, yes, and since I am not providing you with a license you also cannot sue me if it turns out that you somehow installed a Remote Access Tunnel on your devices. /s
