# 👋 jee-mj's dotfiles

## Now with 100% more flakes

### current status: virtualisation STILL does not work

## Yet Another dotFiles Repository

These are my dotFiles for NixOS.

Anyone can use these to build my preferred working environment on a workstation using AMD CPU with NVIDIA GPU.

### Configuration

|           | System | Home     |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| directory | `.nix` | `.flake` |

To change the base system settings (e.g. hardware configuration, system environment packages), use the `.nix` folder. To change anything else, use the `.flake` folder.
